# Scratch to Phonegap

This repo is for people who want to make mobile apps using Scratch. No programming experience beyond Scratch. See the tutorial here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/116055504/

This method uses Phoshporus, a Scratch to JS compiler, and PhoneGap, a JS to mobile app compiler. If you follow my setup, you will never need to push updates to the mobile app, just the Scratch project. The app will always play the current version of the project found on Scratch.
